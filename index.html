        <h4 class="bio-name">Hi, I'm Frentzen Taslim.</h4>
          <h4 class="bio-quote">I love to craft design solutions with purpose and impact to bring positive and enjoyable experiences to the users.</h4>
            <p class="bio-detail">I am currently an Interactive Art and Technology student at Simon Fraser University. 
            My academic journey has been marked by a diverse range of projects where I've enthusiastically applied my creativity and problem-solving skills. 
            Collaborating with my team members, I've crafted enjoyable digital experiences - from user research to wireframing and prototyping in Figma and ProtoPie, and coding websites using HTML and CSS. 
            Outside of design, I usually play chess as it involves strategic thinking, problem-solving, and attention to detail which helps to enhance my skills.
            I believe that design is about prioritizing user empathy and understanding their perspective to create engaging and impactful experiences. 
            With a strong commitment to continuous learning, I eagerly anticipate new challenges that keep me motivated and engaged on my journey to success.
