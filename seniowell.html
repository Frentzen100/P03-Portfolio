    <h3 class="project-section-title">PROJECT OVERVIEW</h3>
      <p>SenioWell is a workout application designed to provide simple exercises for seniors to prevent further stages of osteoporosis and arthritis. </p>
      <p>In this academic project, I collaborated with a team of two to develop a complex and interactive user interface. 
       This involved research to identify suitable exercises and creating prototypes to visualize the app's interactive features </p>

     <h3 class="project-section-title">RESEARCH</h3>
       <h4 class="project-section-subheading">Personas</h4>
         <p>To determine the types of exercises to implement in the app, I decided to create personas to show potential objectives and tasks that seniors may have when engaging with the app.</p>

     <h3 class="project-section-title">DESIGN PROCESS</h3>
     <h4 class="project-section-subheading">Initial Prototype</h4>
     <ul>
       <li>I integrated a scrolling animation effect into the 'finish' button, allowing seniors to input their remaining information seamlessly.
           As a result, this ensured a smoother and quicker sign-up process, as seniors no longer need to manually scroll down to complete their profile, thereby enhancing their overall experience.</li>
       <li>I implemented a new color for the bookmark icon to signify when a workout has been bookmarked. 
           This visual cue made it easier for users to identify which workouts they've saved for future reference.</li>
       <li>I removed the resting period timer to reduce the number of steps required for the workout completion process. 
           This granted users more flexibility in managing their rest periods between exercises, ensuring they're adequately prepared for their next exercise.</li>    
     </ul>

     <h4 class="project-section-subheading">Final Prototype</h4>
     <ul>
       <li>By removing the scrolling effect, seniors found it easier to input their personal information since it eliminated distraction. </li>
       <li>Seniors recovered faster and safely because the exercises selected were proven to be suitable for seniors dealing with osteoporosis and arthritis, based on reputable sources such as Healthline and Harvard Health.</li>
       <li>Seniors found it easier to exercise more regularly, thanks to motivational quotes provided after completing each exercise.</li>
     </ul>

     <h3 class="project-section-title">REFLECTION</h3>
     <p>Thanks to this project, I have deepened my understanding of design principles, usability components, and UI guidelines. 
       If I have more time, I would like to recruit seniors to test my app and use the think-aloud method to understand their decisions. 
       In addition, I would also like to incorporate a music feature to make it easier for seniors to exercise while enjoying. </p>
