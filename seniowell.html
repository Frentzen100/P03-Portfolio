    <h3 class="project-section-title">PROJECT OVERVIEW</h3>
      <p>SenioWell is a workout application designed to provide simple exercises for seniors to prevent further stages of osteoporosis and arthritis.
         In this project, I collaborated with a team of two to develop a complex and interactive user interface. 
         This involved research to identify suitable exercises and creating prototypes to visualize the app's interactive features </p>

    <h3 class="project-section-title">RESEARCH</h3>
      <h4 class="project-section-subheading">Personas</h4>
        <p>To determine the types of exercises to implement in the app, I decided to create personas to show potential objectives and tasks that seniors may have when engaging with the app.</p>
    
    <div id="seniowell-persona">

    <figcaption>Persona for senior who experience oesteoporosis and arthritis</figcaption>
      <h4 class="project-section-subheading">Userflow</h4>
        <p> To create a user flow, I need to first understand the user's goal and pain point when they exercise by analyzing the personas.
           Then, I created relevant features and all the necessary actions the seniors need to accomplish their goal. 
           I did this to ensure all team members have a shared understanding of how we visualized our intended user journey.</p>

     <h4 class="project-section-subheading">Sketches - Home page, Exercise page, Favorite page</h4>
        <p>To determine the types of exercises to implement in the app, I decided to create personas to show potential objectives and tasks that seniors may have when engaging with the app.</p>

      <h4 class="project-section-subheading">Storyboard</h4>
        <p>After conducting research and discovering that seniors required ample rest after each exercise, I decided to provide a longer rest period, with the option for seniors to extend this period if desired.
           Additionally, we utilized short videos to visually demonstrate exercises, as seniors often found it easier to understand visual information. 
           Furthermore, I implemented a congratulatory message feature to motivate seniors to engage in workouts more frequently.</p>

     <h4 class="project-section-subheading">Initial Prototype</h4>
     <ul>
       <li> <span class="key-statement">Increasing Sign-Up Efficiency:</span> I integrated a scrolling animation effect into the 'finish' button, allowing seniors to input their remaining information seamlessly.
           As a result, this ensured a smoother and quicker sign-up process, as seniors no longer need to manually scroll down to complete their profile, thereby enhancing their overall experience.</li>
       <li> <span class="key-statement">Enhancing Visual Clarity:</span> I implemented a new color for the bookmark icon to signify when a workout has been bookmarked. 
           This visual cue made it easier for users to identify which workouts they've saved for future reference.</li>
       <li> <span class="key-statement">Catering To Senior:</span> I removed the resting period timer to reduce the number of steps required for the workout completion process. 
           This granted users more flexibility in managing their rest periods between exercises, ensuring they're adequately prepared for their next exercise.</li>    
     </ul>

     <h4 class="project-section-subheading">Refinement</h4>
     <ul class="refinement">
       <li>I adjusted our workout program to better suit seniors dealing with osteoporosis or arthritis.
           By emphasizing pilates, yoga, and cardio exercises, my updated approach ensures a more tailored fitness regimen for their specific need.</li>

       <li class="bulletless"><figcaption>Changing content in the exercise page</figcaption></li>
       <li>I enhanced the text area where users can specify any allergies they may have.
           This improvement ensures that users can readily identify it as a designated area for inputting allergies and understand the purpose behind its implementation.</li>

     </ul>

     <h4 class="project-section-subheading">Final Prototype</h4>
     <ul>
       <li>By removing the scrolling effect, seniors found it easier to input their personal information since it eliminated distraction. </li>
       <li>Seniors recovered faster and safely because the exercises selected were proven to be suitable for seniors dealing with osteoporosis and arthritis, based on reputable sources such as Healthline and Harvard Health.</li>
       <li>Seniors found it easier to exercise more regularly, thanks to motivational quotes provided after completing each exercise.</li>
     </ul>

     <h3 class="project-section-title">REFLECTION</h3>
     <p>Thanks to this project, I have deepened my understanding of design principles, usability components, and UI guidelines. 
       If I have more time, I would like to recruit seniors to test my app and use the think-aloud method to understand their decisions. 
       In addition, I would also like to incorporate a music feature to make it easier for seniors to exercise while enjoying. </p>
