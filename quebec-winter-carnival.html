    <h2 class="project-section-title">PROBLEM</h2>
      <p>The website lacked a map feature which make tourists finding it difficult to locate the offered activities and their respective locations. 
         In addition, upon researching the existing map interface, it appeared complex and confusing. 
         As a result, users would find it time-consuming to discover the activities they may wish to pursue.</p>

    <figcaption>Current Quebec Winter Carnival map</figcaption>

    <h2 class="project-section-title">RESEARCH</h2>
      <p>My initial task involved researching tourist feedback on TripAdvisor to identify any issues encountered during the winter festival.
       The findings revealed that tourists struggle to locate their desired activities within the festival grounds.
       Consequently, I recommended to my team members to develop an interactive map to streamline visitor navigation.</p>
       <p>Subsequently, I was assigned to determine the essential activities to be featured on the map. 
        To accomplish this, I analyzed popular winter activities showcased on competitor websites, such as Vernon Winter Carnival, Winterlude and Winter Festival of Light. 
        In addition, I also searched for simple attraction map such as Club Penguin to gain inspiration for how our interactive map will look like.</p>

      <div class="two-points-container">
        <div class="three-points">
          <h4>Refining the Element Layout</h4>
            <p> I utilized CSS margin and padding properties to generate white space around crucial elements, thereby enhancing usability by facilitating easy button-clicking and improving overall aesthetics, aiding users in distinguishing between various elements. 
            In addition, I also utilized position properties to overlay the icons onto the map</p>
        </div>

        <div class="three-points">
          <h4>Enhancing the Interactivity</h4>
            <p>In order to make my homepage more interactive, I incorporated animation effects into all call-to-action elements to give them a clickable appearance.
              Furthermore, I incorporated a popup feature on my map webpage to enhance user engagement and allowing users to discover more about the activities.</p>

      <h3 class="project-section-subheading">Challenge</h3>
        <p>The backgrounds of the homepage and about page appeared simple due to the minimal use of decorative elements.
        In addition, the dog illustration looks distracting so therefore, it was hard for the user to focus on the content. </p>

          <h4>Step 1: Minimizing Distraction</h4>
            <p>I decreased the size of the dog illustration and eliminate its speech, ensuring improved readability of the content.</p>

        <div class="three-points">

        <div class="three-points">
          <h4>Step 3: Adding Map Preview</h4>

        <p>As a result of our drastic changes such as adding gradient and decorative elements to the background, we created a more winter-themed and visually appealing interface.
           Furthermore, we have provided additional context about the winter festival, showcasing essential information to offer a comprehensive understanding of the event.</p>

    <h3 class="project-section-title">DESIGN</h3>
     <h4 class="project-section-subheading">Sketches - Home page, Exercise page, Favorite page</h4>
        <p>When I was designing the homepage, I found it challenging for seniors to determine which exercise workouts they should do.
        To solve this problem, I incorporated a recommendation workout section on the homepage, tailored to their medical conditions and preferred difficulty levels as input by the seniors.
        Furthermore, to simplify access for seniors who wish to repeat the same workout every few days without navigating through the exercise program, I introduced a 'Favorite' feature. 
        This feature reduces cognitive effort and enhances the user-friendliness of our app.</p>

      <h4 class="project-section-subheading">Storyboard</h4>
        <p>After conducting research and discovering that seniors required ample rest after each exercise, I decided to provide a longer rest period, with the option for seniors to extend this period if desired.
           Additionally, we utilized short videos to visually demonstrate exercises, as seniors often found it easier to understand visual information. 
           Furthermore, I implemented a congratulatory message feature to motivate seniors to engage in workouts more frequently.</p>

     <ul>
       <li> <span class="key-statement">Increasing Sign-Up Efficiency:</span> I integrated a scrolling animation effect into the 'finish' button, allowing seniors to input their remaining information seamlessly.
           As a result, this ensured a smoother and quicker sign-up process, as seniors no longer need to manually scroll down to complete their profile, thereby enhancing their overall experience.</li>
       <li> <span class="key-statement">Enhancing Visual Clarity:</span> I implemented a new color for the bookmark icon to signify when a workout has been bookmarked. 
           This visual cue made it easier for users to identify which workouts they've saved for future reference.</li>
       <li> <span class="key-statement">Catering To Senior:</span> I removed the resting period timer to reduce the number of steps required for the workout completion process. 
           This granted users more flexibility in managing their rest periods between exercises, ensuring they're adequately prepared for their next exercise.</li>

     <h3 class="project-section-title">REFLECTION</h3>
     <p>At first, I was a beginner in HTML and CSS but thanks to the course professor’s tutorial, YouTube videos, and various learning platforms, I expanded my skills in enhancing website responsiveness and aesthetics.
       By researching web design trends, I discovered effective strategies, including the use of illustrations to create a playful vibe on our website.
       In addition, I also get to learn how my team members use JavaScript to create user interactions, such as coding approaches for implementing pop-up functionalities. </p>
